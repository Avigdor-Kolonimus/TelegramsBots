# TelegramsBots
Hello everyone, I created this repository for my experiments with telegram bots.<br/>
To start working with the telegram bot you have to take the following steps:<br/>
1.  Import one of the libraries from [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/samples) . I imported 'pyTelegramBotAPI' and 'python-telegram-bot'.
2.  In Telegram find @BotFather in search.
3.  Write /newbot.
4.  Choose a name for your bot.
5.  Choose a username for your bot.\
6.  You will find it at t.me/USERNAME_YOUR_BOT
7.  Copy your bot token from @BotFather to your code.
8.  Run code.
<br/>

If you want to check your telegram bot on the server, then there is a free server [here](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).<br/>
Working procedure with this service:<br/>
1.  Create beginner account
2.  Install requirement packages:
    1.  Open link 'Consoles'
    2.  Open Bash
    3.  Run command: 'pip3 install Package --user' 
3.  Upload your telegram bot
    1.  Open link Files
    2.  Click 'Upload a file'
    3.  Upload your files
4.  Run telegram bot

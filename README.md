# TelegramsBots
Hello everyone, I created this repository for my experiments with telegram bots.<br/>
To start working with the telegram bot you have to take the following steps:<br/>
1.  Import one of the libraries from [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/samples) . I imported 'pyTelegramBotAPI'.
2.  In Telegram find @BotFather in search.
3.  Write /newbot.
4.  Choose a name for your bot.
5.  Choose a username for your bot.\
6.  You will find it at t.me/USERNAME_YOUR_BOT
7.  Copy your bot token from @BotFather to your code.
8.  Run code.
